The "SayHello" Kivy app is a simple graphical user interface that prompts the user to input their name and responds with a personalized greeting. 

How to Run:

    Ensure you have Kivy installed (pip install kivy).

    Save the code in a file, e.g., sayhello.py.

    Run the script:

    bash

    python sayhello.py

    The application window will appear, allowing you to input a name and receive a greeting.

Notes:

    The application uses basic Kivy components for GUI creation.
    The image file ("logo.png") should be in the same directory as the script.
